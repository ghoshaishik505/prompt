Second, create a directory structure for the files/folders of Frontend(HTML, CSS, .js, etc), Backend(.py) and Database operations. Next, For each file describe its objective, name and explain the functions , their I/O parameters and endpoints for the APIs. That means, for the backend files along with all the descriptions, mention the API endpoint names for each of the functionalities , and for the frontend files mention when, where and how the each of the API endpoints consumed, structure and execution of the scripts. Create complete architecture for the MongoDB operations as well. Please keep in mind, the Front-end developers will have no viscibility of the code developed either by Backend or Database developers and vice-versa. Everyone will have only the architecture document you create. Hence, make it very detailed and clearly mention the endpoint of APIs and their I/O parameters such that all of them are compatible to each other. Accordingly, make an architecture for a production ready solution."}
